# Church Music Pro - 14 Short Launch Emails (Hormozi Style, Anonymous)

---

**EMAIL 1: The 3AM Scramble**

Musician cancels last minute. You scramble for a replacement. Stress, panic, wasted time. This is normal for most churches. It doesn’t have to be. Let musicians sign up themselves, see open spots, and get instant updates. No more chasing.

**EMAIL 2: Spreadsheet Headache**

Spreadsheets weren’t made for music ministry. Dates get mixed up. People miss info. You spend hours fixing mistakes. Ditch the spreadsheet. Get a system built for churches.
