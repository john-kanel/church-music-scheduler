# Stripe Integration Test Results

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Good news! Your Stripe integration is **mostly working correctly** for the 30-day trial system. I've tested all the key components and here's what I found:

## ✅ What's Working Perfectly

### 1. **Stripe Connection & Authentication**
- ✅ Stripe secret key is valid and connecting successfully
- ✅ Account ID: `acct_1RbkI5DKZUjfTbRb`
- ✅ Country: US, Currency: USD

### 2. **Price Configuration**
- ✅ Monthly Plan: $35/month (`price_1RbkRKDKZUjfTbRbPIstDXUV`)
- ✅ Annual Plan: $200/year (`price_1RbkgaDKZUjfTbRbrVKLe5Hq`)
- ✅ Both prices are valid and active in Stripe

### 3. **Trial Configuration**
- ✅ 30-day trial period is correctly configured
- ✅ No payment method required upfront
- ✅ Automatic conversion to paid subscription after trial

### 4. **Database & Schema**
- ✅ Database connection is working
- ✅ Prisma schema is properly generated
- ✅ All required tables for subscription tracking exist

## ⚠️ Issues That Need Fixing

### 1. **Environment Variables (Critical)**

**Problem**: Two placeholder values in your `.env` file:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_placeholder"
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_placeholder"
```

**Fix Required**: Update your `.env` file:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_51RbkI5DKZUjfTbRb0C0f2YlJFAZ4Z4TvC1e5oSMBnb5HO6BPCYpSfaJaF2f5nO3VtRxQ0Gj90bztFZmikTetBxAU00StKH0S7N"
```

### 2. **Webhook Configuration (Important)**

**Problem**: Webhook secret is placeholder value

**Fix Required**: 
1. Go to your Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
2. Create a new webhook endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Add these events:
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
4. Copy the webhook secret and update your `.env` file:
```env
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_your_actual_webhook_secret_here"
```

## 🔄 How the 30-Day Trial Works

Your system is correctly configured for the following flow:

1. **User Signs Up** → `/auth/signup`
2. **Creates Stripe Checkout** → 30-day trial with no payment required
3. **Account Created** → User gets immediate access to all features
4. **Trial Period** → 30 days of full access
5. **Trial Ends** → Automatic conversion to paid subscription

## 🧪 Testing the Trial System

Once you fix the environment variables, you can test the complete flow:

1. **Visit**: `http://localhost:3000/auth/signup`
2. **Fill out form** with test data
3. **Complete Stripe checkout** (no payment required)
4. **Verify account creation** and immediate access
5. **Check trial status** in billing page
